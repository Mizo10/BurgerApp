# Eat-The-Burger

Eat-The-Burger is a logging application that allows a user to input a burger name which will then appear on the page under the "Burgers to be eaten" section. For further functionality, the user can then choose to "devour" the burger, which will result in the burger being placed in the "Burgers Eaten" section.
